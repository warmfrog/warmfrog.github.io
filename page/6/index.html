</li>
<li><p>如果没有引用库文件，就可以点击 OK了。Build -&gt; Build Artifact, 选择对应的就好了。如果引用了库文件，则在右面板 Available Elements 中找到对应库， 如 mysql-cononctor.jar, 右击-&gt; Extract into OutPut Root, 点击 OK || Apply 就可以了，然后生成 Artifact.</p>

<li><p>在IDEA 中 打开 Project Structure -&gt; Artifacts -&gt; 点击 + 号 -&gt; jar -&gt; emmpy, 对jar 文件重命名，然后在 OUtput Layout 中添加目录，目录结构为你的报结构，将你要添加的类.class 按报结构放到目录中，然后点击 下方 Create Manifest，自己选择一个目录， 选择主类，类路径就不用选了。</p>
</li>
<li><p>如果没有引用库文件，就可以点击 OK了。Build -&gt; Build Artifact, 选择对应的就好了。如果引用了库文件，则在右面板 Available Elements 中找到对应库， 如 mysql-cononctor.jar, 右击-&gt; Extract into OutPut Root, 点击 OK or Apply 就可以了，然后生成 Artifact.</p>
